These are a few points about my implementation and features of my program

1) There is flag calles "sina" that is set to true in the makefile, to be able to pass in command line arguments for
Frame-per-second and the speed of ball, that flag should be set to false

2) The game opens with a splash screen that is basically a help page, to close the splash screen and get into the game press 'h'

3) When in game press 's' to start, 'p' to pause and 'q' to quit

4) My added feature is the following: A number of randomly chosen bricks are colored pink, if the ball hits any of them, the paddle gets
larger for a few seconds
